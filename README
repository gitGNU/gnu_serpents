                               GENERAL

Serpents is a snake-like game, in which you control 3 serpents of
different colors. You start as the red one and can switch to others by
picking up food of a different color. Try to eat as much as possible
without colliding!

Serpents is not yet finished, there are still some things I'd like to
add. Among those are a proper game-over screen and better graphics.
Unfortunately I don't have a lot of time/motivation for it, so if
someone else wants to do it, they are welcome to contribute :-)


                             INSTALLATION

To install Serpents from a git checkout, you will need
autotools, SDL2 and SDL_TTF. First clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jchmrt/serpents.git

Then build it:

    $ cd serpents
    $ autoreconf -vif
    $ ./configure
    $ make

And install it:

    $ sudo make install


                                USAGE

Once you've installed Serpents, you can run it in a terminal with
`serpents'. To see help or version information use `-h' and `-v'
respectively.
